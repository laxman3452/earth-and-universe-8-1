                    <h3>1. Nebular Hypothesis</h3>
                    <p><strong>Simple Idea:</strong> Everything started as a giant, swirling cloud in space.</p>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This theory says the solar system began as a huge, slowly spinning cloud of gas and dust called a **nebula**. Over time, gravity pulled the gas in, causing the cloud to shrink and spin faster. This formed a central, hot bulge (the **protosun**) and a flat, cooling disk. The particles in the disk clumped together, a process called **accretion**, to form the planets, satellites, and asteroids.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Feature:</strong> Explains why all planets orbit and spin in roughly the same direction and flat plane.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tidal Idea:</strong> A passing star pulled matter from the Sun.</p>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The **Tidal theory** suggests a massive **rogue star** passed very close to our Sun. Its strong gravity pulled a giant, hot, cigar-shaped stream of material out from the Sun's surface (like a massive tide). This stream broke up, cooled, and condensed to become the planets.</p>
                    <p>The **Planetesimal theory** explains that this material cooled into tiny, solid pieces called **planetesimals**, which then collided and stuck together to build the planets.</p>

            <h3>1. Origin of Life (The First Steps)</h3>
            <p>Initially, Earth was hostile and hot. As it cooled, simple gases reacted chemically to form complex molecules (like carbohydrates and proteins) in the oceans—this environment is sometimes called the **primordial soup**. Eventually, the first **unicellular** (single-celled) life evolved from these molecules.</p>

        <h2>1. Origin of the Solar System</h2>
        <p>There are several hypotheses regarding the origin of the solar system, including the Sun, planets, and satellites.</p>

        <div class="hypothesis-box">
            <h3>a. Nebular Hypothesis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Proposed by:</strong> Immanuel Kant (1755), revised by Pierre Simon Laplace (1796).</li>
                <li><strong>Simple Idea:</strong> The solar system began as a huge, spherical, slowly rotating cloud of **gas and dust** called a **nebula**.</li>
                <li><strong>Process:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The nebula contracted due to gravity, causing its rotation speed to **increase** (like an ice skater pulling in their arms).</li>
                        <li>The spinning created a central, hot bulge (the **protosun**) and a flat, cooling, spinning disc.</li>
                        <li>Substances within the disc clumped together (**accretion**) to form the planets, satellites, and other members of the solar system.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Specialty:</strong> All planets orbit and spin in the same direction and on the same plane as the solar system.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="hypothesis-box">
            <h3>b. Planetesimal Hypothesis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Proposed by:</strong> Chamberlin and Moulton (1905).</li>
                <li><strong>Simple Idea:</strong> A giant, intruding star approached the Sun.</li>
                <li><strong>Process:</strong> The star's gravity pulled a large amount of matter from the Sun. As this matter cooled and condensed, it formed small, solid bodies called **planetesimals**. These planetesimals then gathered to form the planets.</li>
                <li><strong>Specialty:</strong> States that planets were originally extremely hot but cooled down.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="hypothesis-box">
            <h3>c. Tidal Hypothesis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Proposed by:</strong> Sir James Jeans and Harold Jeffrey (early 20th Century).</li>
                <li><strong>Simple Idea:</strong> A large, rogue star came very close to the Sun.</li>
                <li><strong>Process:</strong> The star's gravitational pull stretched a huge, **cigar-shaped column** of hot matter from the Sun (like a tide). This column broke into pieces that cooled and condensed to form the planets.</li>
                <li><strong>Specialty:</strong> Explains why the larger planets (like Jupiter and Saturn) are in the middle, and the smaller ones (Mercury, Mars, etc.) are at the ends.</li>

    <h2>3. Give reason:</h2>

    <p><strong>(a) Minerals are said to be pure chemicals.</strong></p>
    <p>Minerals are considered pure chemicals because they are naturally occurring, inorganic solids that have a **definite and predictable chemical composition** and a distinct **internal crystalline structure**. This fixed arrangement means they can be represented by a specific chemical formula (e.g., Quartz is SIO2, just like a pure chemical compound.</p>

    <p><strong>(b) Mesozoic Era is also called the era of coniferous.</strong></p>
    <p>The **Mesozoic Era** is called the "Era of Coniferous" (and other gymnosperms) because this group of plants became the **most dominant** and widespread vegetation on Earth. Conifers (like pines and firs) were the main food source for the massive herbivorous **dinosaurs** of that time.</p>

    <p><strong>(c) Living beings have evolved after a very long time on Earth's evolution.</strong></p>
    <p>The Earth needed a very long time to establish the necessary conditions for life. The early Earth was molten, hot, and lacked a stable atmosphere and oceans. It took millions of years for the planet to cool and for simple inorganic molecules to combine into complex **organic molecules** (chemical evolution). Only after this long period could the first simple, single-celled life forms appear.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. Answer the following questions:</h2>

    <h3>(a) What is a mineral? Give examples.</h3>
    <p>A **mineral** is a naturally occurring, inorganic solid that has a definite chemical composition and a regular, internal atomic structure (crystalline structure).<br>
    <strong>Examples:</strong> Quartz ($\text{SiO}_2$), Gypsum, Mica, Iron ore.</p>

    <h3>(b) What are the hypotheses about the origin of the earth? Explain any one of them.</h3>
    <p>The hypotheses generally fall into **Nebular** (formation from a dust/gas cloud) and **Catastrophic/Tidal** (formation from a sudden event) categories.</p>
    <p><strong>Explanation of the Nebular Hypothesis:</strong><br>
    The solar system began as a large, rotating cloud of gas and dust (**nebula**). Due to gravitational contraction, the nebula shrank and spun faster, flattening into a disc. The central part condensed to form the **Sun**, and the leftover material in the spinning disc formed rings, which then cooled and clumped together (accretion) to form the **planets**.</p>

    <h3>(c) Explain the importance of minerals for Nepal.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Economic Development:</strong> Exploiting minerals like limestone, granite, and copper can generate **significant revenue** through exports and local industry.</li>
        <li><strong>Construction Industry:</strong> Minerals like **limestone** are crucial for producing **cement**, a core material for national infrastructure (roads, buildings, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Employment:</strong> Mining and processing industries create thousands of **jobs** for the local population.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Dependency:</strong> Using local resources reduces reliance on expensive **imports** of industrial raw materials.</li>
    </ul>

 

    <h3>(e) Which Era was inappropriate for the evolution of life and why? Explain with an example.</h3>
    <p>The **Precambrian Era** (specifically the earliest **Azoic/Archean** phase) was inappropriate for the evolution of complex life.</p>
    <p><strong>Reason:</strong> The early Earth was **extremely hot**, constantly bombarded by meteorites, and lacked **oxygen** in the atmosphere. These unstable and hostile conditions prevented the formation and survival of complex life forms.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> The high temperatures and volcanic activity would have destroyed any **complex organic molecules** (like DNA or RNA) as soon as they formed.</p>

    <h3>(f) When did mammoths with long tusks and fish with lungs evolve?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>**Mammoths with long tusks:** Evolved during the **Cenozoic Era** (specifically the Pleistocene epoch, or Ice Age).</li>
        <li>**Fish with lungs (Lungfish):** The first fish with lung-like structures evolved during the **Paleozoic Era** (specifically the Devonian period, the "Age of Fish").</li>
    </ul>
